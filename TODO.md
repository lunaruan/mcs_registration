# TODO


### Bugs found with Task Rabbit

[x] Date dropdown doesn't work after information is auto-filled-- discovered this was an issue with the date not being parsed correctly


### Reqs before launch

[~] Safety around adding data-- should not overwrite fields not included in form, specifically thinking about [x] new student form

[x] Typeahead for checking into dance

[~] Square integration-- need to open the web app using Chrome, make an endpoint with firebase functions to handle callbacks


### Reqs for Task Rabbit

[x] A place for everything in the form, including the "for office use only" box


### From 2018-08-29 form filling notes

[x] When you enter the name of the referral, the box should get checked automatically

[x] Phone number validation JS lib -- really not necessary, neither is email validation beyond checking that there's a value

[x] Set default date across the app, save in a cookie that expires in 24 hours

[x] Adjust form size when on desktop

[x] Admin checkin in navbar


### Feature requests

[x] Batch/Admin form data entering mode with minimal steps-- should be very hidden from normal users, only work in desktop mode, enable minimal data entry

[ ] Workshop or special event checkin flow

[ ] Have to manually approve new admin accounts


### JS tools

[ ] What is flow typing? How does it actually work?
